## Deployment

### Setting Up a Testnet

To set up a testnet for Cosmos AppChain, follow these steps:

1. **Network Configuration:**
   - Create a new directory for your testnet and navigate into it.
   - Create a `config` directory within the testnet directory.
   - Generate a Genesis file for your testnet. You can use the following command as a starting point:

     ```bash
     cosmos-appchain init --chain-id <testnet-name> <path-to-genesis-file>
     ```

   - Modify the generated Genesis file to customize parameters such as initial validators, block time, and more.

2. **Validator Setup:**
   - Choose validators to participate in your testnet. Ensure they have the necessary prerequisites installed (Go, Cosmos SDK, etc.).
   - Share the Genesis file with the selected validators.
   - Validators should initialize their nodes using the provided Genesis file:

     ```bash
     cosmos-appchain init --chain-id <testnet-name> --home <validator-node-home>
     ```

3. **Genesis Transactions:**
   - Validators can submit their Genesis transactions to join the network. These transactions include key information such as their public keys and initial token allocations.

     ```bash
     cosmos-appchain gentx --name <validator-name> --amount <staking-amount> --home <validator-node-home>
     ```

   - Validators submit their transactions to the network.

4. **Collect Genesis Transactions:**
   - As the network operator, collect the Genesis transactions from validators.

     ```bash
     cosmos-appchain collect-gentxs --home <your-node-home>
     ```

   - The collected transactions should be added to the Genesis file.

5. **Start the Testnet:**
   - Start the nodes for both the network operator and validators.

     ```bash
     cosmos-appchain start --home <your-node-home>
     ```

   - Your Cosmos AppChain testnet is now up and running!

6. **Connect and Test:**
   - Validators and other participants can now connect to the testnet and test their applications.

### Mainnet Deployment



This is a general guide, and you may need to adjust it based on the specific requirements and parameters of your Cosmos AppChain. Please replace placeholders such as `<testnet-name>`, `<path-to-genesis-file>`, `<validator-node-home>`, `<validator-name>`, `<staking-amount>`, and `<your-node-home>` with the actual values or paths relevant to your project.
